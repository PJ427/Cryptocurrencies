# Cryptocurrencies

## Summary

    Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, has asked us to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.
    
    The data we will be working with is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. We will use unsupervised learning since there is no known output. To group the cryptocurrencies, we will use a clustering algorithm and use data visualizations to share findings with the board.
